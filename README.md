# usbmon tools

This repository contains a Python module and some command line tools to work
with Linux [usbmon](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt), as
well as Windows [usbpcap](https://desowin.org/usbpcap) captures.

Note that this is not an official Google product.

## Tools

In addition to the `usbmon` module, containing the data structures to access USB
captures, this package contains a few scripts in the `tools/` directory, which
can be used to manipulate usbmon captures.
