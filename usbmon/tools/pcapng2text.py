"""Convert a pcapng usbmon capture to usbmon text format.

This is a simple tool that allows generating usbmon text format output based on
the binary (mmap) API.

It tries to stay as close to the current Linux text format as possible, although
with a few notable changes:

 - URBs can be optionally retagged, so that each Submission/Callback pair has a
   unique tag. This is unlike the Linux interface, where the tag is the
   in-memory pointer to the URB structure, and is thus repeated in the same
   capture, as structures are reused. When this is enabled, the tag is a UUID,
   and thus much longer than the kernel's own tag.

 - The timestamp for the captures is provided in full, rather than being
   constrained to 32-bit range.
